# Lab 2 – Host-Based Security (Active Directory & Identity Management)

## Objective
The objective of this lab was to deploy and secure a Windows Active Directory environment.
This included creating a new domain, designing Organizational Units (OUs), managing users and groups,
adding a secondary domain controller using PowerShell, and enforcing security controls through
Fine-Grained Password Policies.

This lab demonstrates enterprise-level identity management, authentication, authorization,
and domain security administration.

## Environment
- Windows Server (Primary Domain Controller)
- Windows Server (Secondary Domain Controller)
- Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
- PowerShell
- Server Manager

## Key Skills Demonstrated

### 🔹 Active Directory Domain Configuration
- Created a new Active Directory domain
- Promoted a server to Domain Controller
- Verified domain functionality and services
- Managed domain-level authentication and authorization

### 🔹 Organizational Units & User Management
- Designed Organizational Units (OUs) for structured identity management
- Created users within appropriate OUs
- Assigned users to security groups
- Demonstrated separation of users by role and department

### 🔹 PowerShell Administration
- Used PowerShell to join a secondary server to the domain
- Executed remote PowerShell commands
- Verified domain membership and connectivity
- Demonstrated automation and command-line administration

### 🔹 Fine-Grained Password Policies (FGPP)
- Created Fine-Grained Password Policies
- Applied different password requirements to specific groups
- Enforced advanced authentication and lockout rules
- Demonstrated granular security policy enforcement beyond default domain policy

---

## Security Concepts Applied
- Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- Principle of Least Privilege
- Centralized authentication and authorization
- Policy-based security enforcement
- Enterprise password and account security

---

## Results
- Successfully deployed and managed an Active Directory domain
- Configured multiple domain controllers
- Implemented advanced password security policies
- Lab completed and submitted for grading

---

## Key Takeaways
- Active Directory is central to enterprise identity security
- Proper OU and group design improves manageability and security
- PowerShell is essential for scalable system administration
- Fine-Grained Password Policies provide stronger, role-based security controls
