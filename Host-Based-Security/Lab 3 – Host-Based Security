# Lab 3 – Host-Based Security (Group Policy, Domain Join & File Services)

## Objective

The objective of this lab was to configure and secure Windows hosts in an Active Directory environment using Group Policy, PowerShell, and domain-based access controls. The lab focused on enforcing host-based security controls, hardening endpoints, and centrally managing authentication and authorization across domain-joined systems.

This lab demonstrates enterprise-level host security administration, policy enforcement, and identity-based access control.

## Environment

- Windows Server (Primary Domain Controller)
- Windows Server (Secondary Domain Controller)
- Windows 10 Domain-Joined Host
- Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
- Group Policy Management Console (GPMC)
- PowerShell
- SMB File Services

## Key Skills Demonstrated

### 🔹 Domain & Identity Management
- Managed Active Directory domains and domain controllers
- Created and organized Organizational Units (OUs)
- Created and managed users and security groups
- Joined a Windows 10 workstation to the domain
- Verified domain authentication and membership

### 🔹 PowerShell Administration
- Used PowerShell for domain configuration and verification
- Executed commands to validate network and domain settings
- Verified applied Group Policies using command-line tools
- Demonstrated automation and administrative efficiency

### 🔹 Group Policy Security Enforcement
- Created and linked Group Policy Objects (GPOs)
- Enforced host-based security policies
- Applied authentication and account security controls
- Enabled auditing and logging policies
- Demonstrated centralized policy management

### 🔹 File Services & Access Control
- Configured SMB file shares on Windows Server
- Applied domain-based permissions to shared resources
- Accessed file shares from a domain-joined Windows 10 host
- Verified access using Active Directory credentials
