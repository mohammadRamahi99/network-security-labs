## 📂 Lab Sections

### 1️⃣ Network Segmentation & VLANs
- Designed segmented networks for users, servers, and management
- Configured inter-VLAN routing
- Applied security controls to reduce lateral movement

### 2️⃣ Traffic Analysis (Wireshark)
- Captured and analyzed network traffic
- Identified suspicious behavior (scans, abnormal TCP activity)
- Documented findings with screenshots and PCAP files

### 3️⃣ Linux Security & CTF Labs
- Completed 50+ Linux-based challenges
- Enumeration, privilege escalation, and system analysis
- Command-line focused troubleshooting

## 🎯 Why This Matters

Cybersecurity is a **hands-on field**.

These labs demonstrate:
- Practical execution
- Repetition and problem-solving
- Real-world readiness

📌 This repository is actively updated as I continue building and documenting labs.
